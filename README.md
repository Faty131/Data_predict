# Public Transport Delay Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts delays in public transportation using operational incident data.

## Objectives
- Identify factors influencing delays
- Build predictive models (RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Provide operational insights

## Dataset
- 54,000+ incidents
- Transport type, line, cause, duration

## Models
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
